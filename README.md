# OS-Simulation
The goal of this project was to simulate how an operating system works. The project was in multiple phases throughout the semester which limited us in the way that we could construct the project. In retrospective, I am certain I could have done it more efficiently and elegantly.
It accepts parameters for the number of processor cores, RAM space (simplified to number of instructions, not bytes), and job schedule methodology. Then it automatically reads the "ugradPart2.txt" provided by the professor. All processes all of the jobs are processed and metrics are printed.
